# Weed Detection and Automated Herbicide Application Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates an automated weed detection and herbicide application system for agricultural fields. The simulation involves capturing virtual images of a crop field, processing the images to detect weeds, and triggering automated herbicide application in response to weed detection.

## Components and Features

1. **Virtual Crop Field Models:**
   - Simulated environment with various crops, including weed infestations.

2. **Virtual Imaging System:**
   - Model of a virtual imaging system for capturing images of the crop field.

3. **Embedded System Simulation:**
   - Simulation of a microcontroller-based embedded system responsible for image processing, weed detection, and herbicide application control.

4. **Weed Detection Algorithms:**
   - Implementation of image processing algorithms to identify the presence of weeds in simulated crop images.

5. **Automated Herbicide Application:**
   - Simulation of the automated release of herbicide in response to detected weed locations in the virtual field.

6. **User Interface:**
   - Development of a user interface to display simulated crop images, highlight detected weeds, and provide information on herbicide application.

## Simulation Tools and Languages

1. **Simulation Tools:**
   - Utilization of Proteus for hardware simulation, modeling the behavior of the embedded system and imaging components.

2. **Microcontroller Simulation:**
   - Simulation of a microcontroller (Arduino or Raspberry Pi) within Proteus.

3. **Programming Language:**
   - Use of C/C++ for simulating microcontroller behavior and implementing image processing algorithms.

## How to Run the Simulation

1. **Install Proteus:**
   - Download and install Proteus from [Proteus Official Website](https://www.labcenter.com/).

2. **Open Project File:**
   - Open the project file `weed_detection_simulation.pdsprj` in Proteus.

3. **Run Simulation:**
   - Start the simulation to observe the virtual crop field, weed detection, and automated herbicide application.

## Use Cases

1. **Image Capture and Weed Detection Simulation:**
   - Simulate the process of capturing images of the crop field and identifying weed locations.

2. **Automated Herbicide Application Simulation:**
   - Simulate the release of herbicide in response to detected weed locations in the virtual environment.

3. **User Interaction:**
   - Interact with the simulation by viewing processed images, identified weeds, and observing the automated herbicide application.
