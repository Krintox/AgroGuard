# Embedded System for Temperature Control

## Overview
Simulate an embedded system designed for temperature control, leveraging virtual sensors and actuators. Explore the implementation of a PID controller algorithm for precise temperature regulation.

## Features
1. **Virtual Temperature Sensor:**
   - Simulate a temperature sensor to provide input data for the embedded system.
   - Introduce variations in the simulated ambient temperature to test the system's responsiveness.

2. **PID Controller Algorithm:**
   - Implement a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for accurate and stable temperature control.
   - Fine-tune PID parameters to optimize the system's response to changes in temperature.

3. **Actuator Simulation:**
   - Simulate an actuator (e.g., a heater or cooler) to control the virtual environment's temperature.
   - Observe how the actuator responds to PID control signals and adjusts the temperature accordingly.

4. **Real-Time Visualization:**
   - graphical interface for real-time visualization of temperature, setpoints, and control signals.
   - user-friendly controls to interact with the system, such as setting desired temperature targets.

## Technologies Used
1. **Simulation Tool:**
   - simulation tools such as Proteus, Simulink etc to create the virtual embedded system.

2. **Programming Language:**
    programming language like C, Python, or a language compatible with the chosen simulation tool to implement the PID controller and system logic.

3. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
