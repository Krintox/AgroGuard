# AgroGaurd

AgroGaurd is an IoT-based smart agricultural system designed to monitor and control various environmental factors affecting plant growth. It utilizes sensors and modules for real-time data collection and automation of irrigation and climate control processes.

## Overview

AgroGaurd connects to the internet and uses sensors to gather real-time data on temperature, soil moisture, and rain detection. It employs automation to regulate irrigation, adjust climate conditions, and notify users of critical events through GSM communication.

## Simulation

The project is simulated using Proteus, a virtual prototyping software. The simulation environment allows testing and validation of the AgroGaurd system before real-world implementation.

## Components Used

- **Soil Moisture Sensor**: Measures the moisture content of the soil.
- **ADC Module**: Converts analog signals from sensors to digital data.
- **LCD Display Module**: Displays real-time data and system status.
- **Temperature Sensor**: Measures ambient temperature.
- **Relay Module (RL1)**: Controls the irrigation system based on sensor readings.
- **Rain Sensor**: Detects the presence of rain.
- **GSM Module**: Enables communication for alerts and notifications.

## Installation and Setup

1. Install Proteus simulation software on your computer.
2. Open the AgroGaurd simulation project file.
3. Connect the virtual components as per the schematic diagram.
4. Run the simulation to observe system behavior and test functionalities.

## Usage

1. Power on the simulation environment.
2. Monitor the LCD display for real-time data updates.
3. Observe how the system reacts to changes in environmental conditions.
4. Test the irrigation and climate control automation features.
5. Verify GSM communication for receiving notifications.
